## 📊 **How Otto Monitors**

Otto uses the Vercel API to:
- Check deployment status automatically
- Fetch build logs if errors occur
- Parse errors and fix them
- Push fixes and redeploy
- Keep trying until success

---

## 🎯 **What You Need To Do**

**Nothing!** Just let Otto work:

- ❌ Don't watch build logs
- ❌ Don't check Vercel dashboard  
- ❌ Don't copy/paste errors
- ✅ Just wait for Otto to report back!

---

## 📱 **What Otto Will Tell You**

Otto will report:
- ✅ **"Deployment successful!"** → Site is live
- 🔧 **"Fixing error X..."** → Working on it
- ❓ **"Need help with error Y"** → If it can't auto-fix

## 🔍 **Want to See What Otto Sees?**

You can check anytime with:

python tools/infra.py diag --provider vercel
```

But you don't need to - Otto will tell you when done!
