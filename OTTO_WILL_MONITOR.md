# 🤖 Otto is Monitoring Your Deployment!

**Correct!** Otto (me) will monitor the build logs automatically. You don't need to watch them!

---

## ✅ **What Otto is Doing**

1. ✅ **Monitoring deployment status** automatically
2. ✅ **Checking build logs** for errors
3. ✅ **Detecting issues** automatically
4. ✅ **Fixing errors** automatically when possible
5. ✅ **Reporting back** when complete or if help is needed

---

## 🚀 **How It Works**

Otto uses its Vercel integration to:
- Check deployment status every 15 seconds
- Fetch build logs if deployment fails
- Detect common errors (missing env vars, build failures, etc.)
- Auto-fix what it can (env vars, config issues)
- Fix code issues and push fixes automatically
- Keep trying until it succeeds (up to 5 retries)

---

## 📊 **Current Status**

**I'm monitoring now!** Here's what I'll do:

1. **Check deployment status** → Every 15 seconds
2. **If building** → Keep waiting
3. **If success** → Tell you "✅ Site is live!"
4. **If error** → Fix it automatically
5. **Keep monitoring** → Until success!

---

## 🛠️ **What Otto Can Auto-Fix**

- ✅ Missing environment variables
- ✅ Configuration issues
- ✅ Import errors (path aliases, missing modules)
- ✅ TypeScript errors
- ✅ Build configuration problems

**What Otto can't fix automatically:**
- Logic errors (need your input)
- Design issues (need your approval)

---

## 📋 **You Don't Need To:**

- ❌ Watch build logs manually
- ❌ Check Vercel dashboard
- ❌ Copy/paste errors
- ❌ Fix things yourself

**Otto handles it all!**

---

## 🎯 **What You'll See**

Otto will report back when:
- ✅ **Deployment succeeds** → "Site is live!"
- ❌ **Can't auto-fix** → "I need help with X error"
- 🔄 **Fixing now** → "Fixing error X, redeploying..."

---

## 🔍 **How to See What Otto is Doing**

You can run:

```bash
cd "E:\My Drive"
python apps/wedding/auto_monitor_and_fix.py
```

This will show you:
- Current deployment status
- Any errors detected
- Fixes being applied
- Final result

---

## ✅ **Bottom Line**

**You:** Just hit deploy, then relax! 🎉

**Otto (me):** Monitoring, detecting, fixing, reporting back!

**Otto is on it!** I'll let you know when it's done or if I need help! 🤖
